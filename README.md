# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

We were tasked with providing Steve with data analysis on a selection of stocks so that he can appropriately advise his first clients (and also parents) on making informed investments in green energy.

### Methods

Steve provided information for green energy stocks for us to analyze; for each day of data collection, the excel sheet included information on the opening, high, low, and closing prices, as well as the adjusted closing price and volume for each organization.

Using this data, our goal was to find the Total Daily Volume and percent return on investment for each provided green energy stock.

To find the Total Daily Volume for each stock, the volumes for each stock for each day were added together.

To find the percent return, we first determined the closing price for the earliest data point date and the closing price for the most recent data point date. We used the following provided format to calculate the return:

return = (Final Closing Price / Starting Closing Price) - 1

## Results

-the analysis is well described with screenshots and code
